# COS 475 Labs/Coursera Machine Learning
**Team Members: Ben Montgomery, Daniel Shepard II, Emily Wall**

*Fall 2018*

## Introduction
In addition to regular coursework, including project assignments, USM's 2018 course COS 475: Machine Learning used [Andrew Ng's][0] Coursera projects as biweekly labs. As such, the projects rely on pre-built MATLAB frameworks, and focus on implementing the actual machine learning algorithms.


## Contributing

Contributions are limited to team members.

### Naming Policies
1. Keep all the file names the same.
2. For each project, place them in folders named `project-1` through `project-n`.
